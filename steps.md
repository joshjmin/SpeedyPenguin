# Steps

1. Fill in readme.md

2. EACH PERSON must copy logs/copy_and_rename.md and name it for themselves.

3. Update logs/group_log.md each time you meet.

4. Consider beginning by reading either the pygame or the tkinter samples under sawczak_demo.

5. All your code should be under src. All your assets should be under src/assets.

6. Keep track of sources using sources.md.

7. Remember to begin every session by PULLING each other's code and finishing by PUSHING yours.
